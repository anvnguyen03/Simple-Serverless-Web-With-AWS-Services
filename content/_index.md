# Building a Simple Serverless Product Management Website with DynamoDB, Lambda, API Gateway and S3

### Overview
 In this guide, we will learn how to create a simple serverless website using AWS services like DynamoDB, Lambda, API Gateway, and S3. The application will include CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) features for managing products. With the serverless approach, we wonâ€™t need to manage servers, allowing us to focus on building our application while keeping costs low and scaling easily.
